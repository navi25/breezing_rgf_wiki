The UI is same as [PD Test Module](https://github.com/navi25/breezing_rgf/wiki/PD-Test-(Photo-Diode-Test)) or [Environmental Sensor Module](). 

* User will hit the scan button and all the mask devices in the vicinity will be shown.
* User can then select one of the devices.
* Make the Bluetooth connection with the device using [Bluetooth Dev Module]()
* Start collecting RSSI data value for 10 seconds and show the result.
* In the end, generate CSV.
